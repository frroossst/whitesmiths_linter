After picking up the whitemsiths indentation style from my first internship, I simply can't go back to any other
style, the whitesmiths style makes blocks of code clear visually, This style of indent fits in perfectly with the
Gestalt Principles of vision.

And that is the life of a programmer, come across something, pick that has a hill to die on, write tools to automate
said task, and of course convert everyone else to your way of programming.

NOTE : Not the best, quick and dirty, gets the job done decently well, I still have to go through the codebase to fix things
here and there but saves me time and that's that


Limitations : 
1. Doesn't work great with inline brackets
2. Doesn't recognise scope and levels so you might find consequent brackets lined up
